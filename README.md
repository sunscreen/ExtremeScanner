# ExtremeScanner

## Description
Extreme Network (EDP) scanner, although it isnt vendor specific ;)

This code is able to scan a batch of Network Ranges in order to detect and store Extreme Devices, Juniper Devices, and Unknown Devices, for later scanning.
It will output a Vis JS network map with the resultant data.. nothing is fabricated, this allows you to see the EDP relationships of your devices multiple EDP neighbors deep, meaning you SEE the reverse references because reality is switched on, but you wont see all the brokeness that is prevalent on the most imminent switch makers equipment. With that said its easy enough to make it only work 1 neighbor deep if you didn't want the cross referencing.

I will upload a script that will convert the stencils to the Js files and a new vendor_db.js which i am streamlining and tidying further it was once a HTML table that i converted to a 8MB json file I then streamlined it to 2MB, now it needs sorting and streamlining again. I will upload the bulkyer incarnation for the mean time should some one want to test the code.
