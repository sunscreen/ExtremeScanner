# ExtremeScanner
EDP Scanner for Extreme
SoonTM: Code to convert stencils (must be done via libvisio2svg)
SoonTM: Stream lined: ExtremeVendor_db.json (you will noticed Vendor db is missing so the code is not in a functional state yet)
This code is able to scan a batch of Network Ranges in order to detect and store Extreme Devices, Juniper Devices, and Unknown Devices, for later scanning.
