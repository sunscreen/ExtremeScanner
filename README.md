# ExtremeScanner

## Description
Extreme Network (EDP) scanner, although it isnt vendor specific ;)

This code is able to scan a batch of Network Ranges in order to detect and store Extreme Devices, Juniper Devices, and Unknown Devices, for later scanning.
It will output a Vis JS network map with the resultant data.. nothing is fabricated, this allows you to see the EDP relationships of your devices multiple EDP neighbors deep, meaning you SEE the reverse references because reality is switched on.
